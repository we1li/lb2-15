Yesterday I got so scared
I shivered like a child
Yesterday away from you
It froze me deep inside
Come back, come back
Don't walk away
Come back, come back
Come back today
Come back, come back
What can't you see?
Come back, come back
Come back to me
And I know I was wrong
When I said it was true
That it couldn't be me and be her
In between without you
Without you
